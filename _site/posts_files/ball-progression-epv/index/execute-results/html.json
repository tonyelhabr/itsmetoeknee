What are they? Well, every PV model is different, but they all generally try to assign value to every on-ball action on the pitch. Such a model can help inform decisions about how to improve player and team performance.\n\n[^1]: Except in [this post](/posts/soccer-league-strength/), where I only briefly mention that I use a PV model.\n\nI heard someone recently say something like \"PV models in soccer basically come down to ball progression\". That's an interesting thought, and I add a hunch that it probably isn't too wrong.\n\nOne way of getting at that idea is to look at how your PV model treats incomplete passes. Does it say that all long passes are \"good\"? What is the importance of the starting and end points of the pass? How does PV for an unsuccessful pass compare to a successful one, holding all else equal?\n\nI attempt to answer some of these questions with [a VAEP model](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/vaep)--an [open-source PV model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/possession-is-the-puzzle-of-soccer-analytics-these-models-are-trying-to-solve-it/).[^2][^3]\n\n[^2]: My model is trained on 2013/14 - 2023/24 English Premier League data.\n\n[^3]: While all PV models [are similar conceptually](https://statsbomb.com/soccer-metrics/possession-value-models-explained/), it's important to identify how they differ in their target variables. VAEP specifically tries to quantify the difference in the probability of scoring and conceding in the next 10 actions. In contrast, expected threat (xT)--perhaps the most well-known PV model--tries to quantify only the probability of scoring in the next 5 actions, not accounting for the conceding probability, which can undermine the \"risk\" associated with incomplete passes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Possession Value (PV) for Passes\n\n## Completed Passes\n\nWe'll want to eventually look at the PV of incomplete passes, but it's probably easier to start with completed passes, as we have a pretty strong intuition about them--pass the ball successfully closer to the goal, and you're most likely helping your team (i.e. positive PV).\n\n### From One Spot, To Anywhere on the Pitch\n\nIn the interactive 8x12 pitch below, the blue cell illustrates where a pass is made, and the colored cells illustrate the average PV associated with all historicalLY successful passes made to that area. Hovering over a cell shows the PV value above the pitch as well.[^4]\n\n[^4]: Do not be alarmed by the small values! Values between 0.02 and 0.02 are very common for PV models. After all, the values represent goal probabilities over sequence of actions, and goals don't happen all that frequently in soccer.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this illustration matches intuition--forward completed passes into the final third should be assigned A non-trivial positive value.\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| include: true\n//| fig-cap: A heatmap showing the average possession value (PV) of historically completed passes from the center spot (annotated in blue) to all areas on the pitch. The relative frequency of successful passes from the center spot to each other cell is shown as a percentage.

It stays basically at around the final quarter of the pitch. So you can't just complete a 30-yard pass from the top of your own box progressing the ball towards the middle of the pitch and expect to get anywhere near the same PV as completing a 30-yard pass from the center of the pitch to near the opponent's 18-yard box. The end point really matters.\n\nThis conclusion gets at our primary question--\"Are all long passes good?\"--to which the answer so far is \"not quite\" (in the sense that \"good\" is more than just \"positive PV\" for completed passes). A long completed pass in your own half doesn't boast a huge positive PV. To get a more complete perspective, we'll plot out the PV for incomplete passes to see what the answer is there.\n\n## Incomplete Passes\n\n### From One Spot, To Anywhere on the Pitch\n\nLet's start with an example again, looking at PV for unsuccessful passes from the center spot.\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| include: true\n//| fig-cap: A heatmap showing the average possession value (PV) of historically incomplete passes from the center spot (annotated in blue) to all areas of the pitch. The relative frequency of unsuccessful passes from the center spot to each other cell is shown as a percentage.

Incomplete passes forward mostly have neutral PVs, with some spots on the pitch having slightly positive PVs. Notably, a positive PV for an incomplete pass is a non-trivial realization (even if the positive PV is relatively small compared to an analogous successful pass).\n\n[^5]: We observe lots of missingness near the defender's box. Such incomplete passes backward would be very illogical no matter the game situation, so it's not surprising to see that such passes are not observed in our data set.\n\nSome of the positive PV cells include the area at the top of the 18-yard box, i.e. [\"zone 14\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EFtACGzD7E). You can make the argument that the \"risk\" of losing possession to passes to zone 14 is justified from the potential to take a shot. Further, a loss of possession in this area can be advantageous, as it leaves the opponent likely in a vulnerable position.\n\n### From Anywhere on the Pitch, To Anywhere on the Pitch\n\nNow let's scale up our pass PV grid to all incomplete passes. As with the dynamic successful pass heatmap, hovering over a cell will show PV associated with unsuccessful passes from that point on the pitch.\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| include: true\n//| fig-cap: A heatmap showing the average possession value (PV) of historically incomplete pass from the hover spot to all areas on the pitch.

Black cells represent areas to which unsuccessful passes from the hover spot have never been made.\n{\n  const chart = d3.create(\"div\").style(\"background-color\", \"8f8f8f\")\n  const title = chart.append(\"div\").attr(\"id\", \"heatmap-title-incomplete-empirical-nested\")\n  title.append(\"p\").html(`min PV: <span id='pv-min-incomplete-empirical-nested'>0</span>, max PV: <span id='pv-max-incomplete-empirical-nested'>0</span>`)\n  chart.append(\"div\").attr(\"id\", \"heatmap-incomplete-empirical-nested\")\n  \n  const legendSwatchContainer = chart.append(\"div\")\n    .attr(\"id\", \"heatmap-legend-incomplete-empirical-nested\")\n    .style(\"display\", \"flex\")\n    .style(\"flex-direction\", \"column\")\n    .style(\"align-items\", \"center\")\n    .style(\"width\", \"100%\");\n  \n  const legendRange = [\n    1.1 * d3.min(colorScaleIncompleteRange),\n    1.1 * d3.max(colorScaleIncompleteRange)\n  ];\n  const stepSize = (legendRange[1] - legendRange[0]) / (swatchParams.num - 1);\n  const legendSwatches = d3.range(legendRange[0], legendRange[1] + stepSize, stepSize);\n  legendSwatches[legendSwatches.length - 1] = legendRange[1];\n  \n  const totalLegendWidth = swatchParams.width * swatchParams.num;\n  \n  const swatchRow = legendSwatchContainer.append(\"div\")\n    .style(\"display\", \"flex\")\n    .style(\"justify-content\", \"center\")\n    .style(\"width\", \"100%\");\n  \n  swatchRow.selectAll(\"div\")\n    .data(legendSwatches)\n    .enter()\n    .append(\"div\")\n    .style(\"width\", `${swatchParams.width}px`)\n    .style(\"height\", `${swatchParams.height}px`)\n    .style(\"background-color\", d => colorScaleIncomplete(d));\n  \n  const labelRow = legendSwatchContainer.append(\"div\")\n    .style(\"display\", \"flex\")\n    .style(\"justify-content\", \"center\")\n    .style(\"width\", `${totalLegendWidth}px`);\n  \n  labelRow.selectAll(\"span\")\n    .data(colorScaleIncompleteRange)\n    .enter()\n    .append(\"span\")\n    .text(d => {\n      if (d === d3.min(colorScaleIncompleteRange)) {\n        return d + \" <=\";\n      } else if (d === d3.max(colorScaleIncompleteRange)) {\n        return \">= \" + d;\n      }\n      return d;\n    })\n    .style(\"flex\", d => d === 0 ? \"1\" : null)\n    .style(\"text-align\", \"center\")\n  \n  return chart.node();\n}\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\n//| output: false\n{  \n  const heatmap_incomplete_empirical_nested = d3_soccer.heatmap(pitch)\n    .colorScale(d3.scaleLinear().domain([-1, 1]).range([\"white\", \"white\"]))\n    .enableInteraction(true)\n    .onSelect((x, y, v) => {\n      const rawMinValue = d3.min(v, d => d.value);\n      const rawMaxValue = d3.max(v, d => d.value);\n      const minValue = Math.max(rawMinValue, -1);\n      const maxValue = Math.min(rawMaxValue, 1);\n  \n      d3.select('#pv-min-incomplete-empirical-nested').text(minValue.toFixed(3));\n      d3.select('#pv-max-incomplete-empirical-nested').text(maxValue.toFixed(3));\n      const cells = d3\n        .select(\"#heatmap-incomplete-empirical-nested\")\n        .selectAll(\"rect.cell\")\n        .data(v);\n  \n      cells.enter()\n        .merge(cells)\n        .attr(\"x\", d => d.x)\n        .attr(\"y\", d => d.y)\n        .attr(\"width\", d => d.width)\n        .attr(\"height\", d => d.height)\n        .style(\"fill\", d => colorScaleIncomplete(+d.value));\n        \n      d3.select(\"#heatmap-incomplete-empirical-nested\")\n        .selectAll(\"text\")\n        .remove();\n        \n      cells.each(function(d, i) {\n        const cell = d3.select(this.parentNode);\n        const bbox = this.getBBox();\n        cell.append(\"text\")\n          .attr(\"x\", bbox.x + bbox.width / 2)\n          .attr(\"y\", bbox.y + bbox.height / 2)\n          .attr(\"text-anchor\", \"middle\")\n          .attr(\"alignment-baseline\", \"central\")\n          .style(\"font-size\", \"3px\")\n          .style(\"pointer-events\", \"none\")\n          .text((d.prop * 100).toFixed(1) + \"%\");\n      });\n      \n      cells.exit().remove();\n  \n      d3.select(\"#heatmap-incomplete-empirical-nested\")\n        .selectAll(\"rect.cell\")\n        .data(incomplete_empirical_nested_pv_data);\n    })\n    .parent_el(\"#heatmap-incomplete-empirical-nested\")\n    .interpolate(false);\n  \n  d3.select(\"#heatmap-incomplete-empirical-nested\")\n    .html(\"\")\n    .datum(incomplete_empirical_nested_pv_data)\n    .call(heatmap_incomplete_empirical_nested);\n}\n```\n\n\nHovering my mouse over various areas in the middle third of the pitch, I consistently see slightly positive values near the top of the 18-yard box. This is not all that dissimilar from the trend observed with the successful pass pitch, where the passes into the final quarter of the pitch had strong positive PV from basically anywhere. And, like the interactive pitch for completed passes, a 30-yard incomplete pass forward from one's own 18-yard box doesn't have the same PV as a 30-yard incomplete pass forward from the half line to the opponent's 18-yard box. Not all long incomplete passes are judged equally.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo, overall, my takeaways are as follows:\n\n1.  Not all long passes add the same kind of value. The pass really needs to be one that ends up near the box to create non-trivial positive PV\n2.  And, while completed passes will almost always add more value, incomplete passes can also have positive PV when they're played into dangerous areas.\n\nFor those who have built PV models or are very familiar with them in some way, perhaps the latter observation is not an unsurprising result. Indeed, we'd hope that a PV model is able to see past the outcome of a pass and properly quantify the threat that a through ball can have, whether it's completed or not.\n\n## Caveats\n\n-   The choice of model surely plays a role in the inference we'll make. Even [atomic VAEP](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/sports/blog/introducing-atomic-spadl:-a-new-way-to-represent-event-stream-data), the cooler younger brother to the baseline VAEP model, may yield different answers due to the way that it treats passes.[^6]\n\n-   Along the same lines, the gradients in the pitches are only as \"good\" as the quality of the model. While the cells show average PV values over many passes--there are over 3.4M total passes in the data set--the PV value may not match intuition if the model doesn't account for all relevant factors. If headed passes weren't treated differently from footed passes, the gradients would likely show a lot more noise due to the randomness at which headed passes are successfully made.\n\n-   The endpoint of incomplete passes is subject to a fundamental source of noise--interception locations. I've implicitly assumed that unsuccessful passes are intercepted very near the intended target, but this is not always the case. Interceptions where, for example, the defender blocks a long through ball near where the pass is made, can skew the model training, exaggerating the value of short incomplete passes.\n\n[^6]: Atomic VAEP splits passes into two actions--the pass itself and the reception (or lack of).\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| include: false\npitch = d3_soccer.pitch()\n  .height(300)\n  .rotate(false)\n  .showDirOfPlay(true)\n  .shadeMiddleThird(false)\n  .pitchStrokeWidth(0.5)\n  .clip([[0, 0], [105, 68]]);\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| include: false\nd3 = require(\"d3@v5\")\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| include: false\nd3_soccer = require(\"d3-soccer@0.1.0\")\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: complete_empirical_prop_data\n//| include: false\ncomplete_empirical_prop_data  = FileAttachment(\"complete_empirical_prop_data.json\").json()\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: complete_empirical_pv_data\n//| include: false\ncomplete_empirical_pv_data  = FileAttachment(\"complete_empirical_pv_data.json\").json()\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: complete_empirical_nested_pv_data\n//| include: true\ncomplete_empirical_nested_pv_data = FileAttachment(\"complete_empirical_nested_pv_data.json\").json()\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: incomplete_empirical_pv_data\n//| include: false\nincomplete_empirical_pv_data  = FileAttachment(\"incomplete_empirical_pv_data.json\").json()\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: incomplete_empirical_nested_pv_data\n//| include: true\nincomplete_empirical_nested_pv_data = FileAttachment(\"incomplete_empirical_nested_pv_data.json\").json()\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: colorScaleCompleteRange\n//| include: false\ncolorScaleCompleteRange = [-0.025, 0, 0.025]\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: colorScaleIncompleteRange\n//| include: false\ncolorScaleIncompleteRange = [-0.025, 0, 0.025]\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: colorScaleComplete\n//| include: false\ncolorScaleComplete = d3.scaleLinear()\n  .domain(colorScaleCompleteRange)\n  .range([\"#a6611a\", \"white\", \"#018571\"]).clamp(true)\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: colorScaleIncomplete\n//| include: false\ncolorScaleIncomplete = d3.scaleLinear()\n  .domain(colorScaleIncompleteRange)\n  .range([\"#d01c8b\", \"white\", \"#4dac26\"]).clamp(true)\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: swatchParams\n//| include: false\nswatchParams = {\n  return {\n    width: 40,\n    height: 20,\n    num: 7\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: passStartParams\n//| include: false\npassStartParams = {\n  return {\n    x: 43.75,\n    y: 34\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| label: cellParams\n//| include: false\ncellParams = {\n  return {\n    width: 8.75,\n    height: 8.5\n  }\n}\n```\n",
