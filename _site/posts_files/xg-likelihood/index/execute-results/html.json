That's one end of the spectrum.\n\nThe other end of the spectrum is \"How unexpected (or \"unlikely\") was player X's shooting performance this season?\" That question is often posed when observing a large difference in a player's goals scored and expected goals (xG). For instance, if a player only scored 5 goals in a given season on 8 xG, their \"under-performance\" of 3 goals is certainly notable, as its about 37.5% lower than expected (i.e. `(5 - 8) / 8`). The \"Overperformance ($O$)\" ratio of goals to expected goals (G / xG)--[I've written about before](posts/xg-ratio-empirical-bayes/)--is the common way of understanding shooting performance. Intuitively, an $O$ ratio of 1 indicates that a player is scoring as many goals as expected; a ratio greater than 1 indicates underperformance; and a ratio less than 1 indicates overperformance\n\nSince then, I've been asked how would go about quantifying how unlikely an individual player's season was.\n\nIn this post I show several approaches to doing so.\n\n## Approach 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
