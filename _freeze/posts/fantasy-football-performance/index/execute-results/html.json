If you've scored the third most points but your current placing is eighth because you've happened to have the most points scored against you, then of course you have grounds to feel slighted.\n\nBut are there other ways you can go about justifying your dissatisfaction? Yes, indeed I can think of three:\n\n1.  **All-play record**: What would your position in the league table be if every team played all other teams in head-to-head matchups every week?\n2.  **Actual points scored compared to projection**: Are you scoring less than your projected total? Is your team under-performing more than other teams compared to their projected scores?\n3.  **Points \"left on the bench\"**: How many points could you have had if you had started the best possible lineup (with the benefit of hindsight)?\n\nI want to look at how we can calculate these things for the past 5 years of my primary fantasy football league (yes, like most sickos, I have multiple league). Comparing counter-factual scores should build up some intuition about all the ways that things can go wrong.\n\n## Analysis and Results\n\n\n\n\n\n### All-play records\n\n\n\n\n\n![](latest-all-play-h2h.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n![](total-all-play-h2h.png)\n\n### Actual vs. projected points\n\n### Lost Opportunity\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOf course, a lot of things are out of one's control--i.e. you generally don't have any influence on your opponent's score in a given week--but our look into lost opportunity is something that could serve as an impetus for action. Knowing that, on average, players in my leagues lose out on about \\~20 points every week due to sub-optimal lineup choices can make me reconsider how I think about \"upside\" with bench players.\n",
