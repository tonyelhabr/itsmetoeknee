## Introduction

This blog post is my attempt to replicate the results in Laurie Shaw's 2018 blog post ["Exceeding Expected Goals"](http://eightyfivepoints.blogspot.com/2018/09/exceeding-expected-goals.html). Specifically, I want to shed light on how to implement [Gamma-Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method#Poisson%E2%80%93gamma_model) [empirical Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method) (EB) estimation. If you don't care at all about the theory behind EB and its application to this context, then go ahead and skip ahead to the "Implementation" section.

### What Is empirical Bayes (EB) estimation?

**Empirical Bayes** (EB) estimation. Wow, just typing that out makes me feel smart. But what is it, really? In short, I'd describe it as a mix of [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) and [Frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) inference. We lean into the observed frequencies of the data (Frequentist) while simultaneously refining our initial data assumptions through Bayesian updating. In practice, one might use EB as a (relatively) simple alternative to a full Bayesian analysis, which can feel daunting.

In regular Bayesian analysis, you start with your initial "guess" (prior distribution) about something, and as you gather data, you tweak that "guess" using Bayes' theorem to get a final view (posterior distribution). We combine what we thought about the data beforehand with how likely the data matches (likelihood).

Empirical Bayes puts a twist on this. Instead of having a prior guess, you figure out that initial guess from the same data you're analyzing. This can make things simpler, especially when you're dealing with tons of guesses but not much initial info.

### A canonical example of EB estimation (Beta-Binomial)

[David Robinson](https://github.com/dgrtwo) wrote [a wonderful blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical_bayes_baseball/) about empirical Bayes estimation for estimating [batting averages in baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)), notably "shrinking" the battering average sof those with relatively few at bats closer to some "prior" estimate derived from a choice of hyperparameters. For context, batting average, $BA$, is defined as a player's count of hits, $H$, divided by the count of their at-bats, $AB$.

$$
BA = H / AB
$$ {#eq-ba}

::: callout-note
I'd David's post **must read** material prior to going through this blog post.
:::

In his post, David uses [a Beta prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) and [a binomial posterior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) together, i.e. a [Beta-binomial Bayesian model](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-3))[^1][^2], since this tandem is suitable for proportions and probabilities. The gist of his approach: we add some fixed number of hits, $\alpha_0$, and a fixed number of at-bats, $\beta_0$, to the numerator and denominator of the battering average equation as so.

[^1]: This [conjugate distribution table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior) might be handy for those curious to know which distributions are typically paired together for empirical Bayes estimation.

[^2]: If you've seen my work, you might have noticed that I've used Beta-Binomial EB a few times for public projects in the past:

    1.  [to estimate the proportion of direct free kick shots on target (soccer), grouped by league](https://twitter.com/TonyElHabr/status/1457377069957107715?s=20)
    2.  [to adjust Whataburger Yelp reviews for small sample sizes](https://twitter.com/TonyElHabr/status/1429610210964955137?s=20)

$$
(H + \alpha_0) / (AB + \alpha_0 + \beta_0)
$$ {#eq-adj-ba}

Specifically, the "prior" estimate of batting average is found from isolating the $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ elements:

$$
\alpha_0 / (\alpha_0 + \beta_0)
$$ {#eq-ba-prior}

If, for example, `alpha0 = 70` and `beta0 = 230`, then the prior estimate of batting average is effectively `70 / (70 + 230) = 0.3`. Note that `alpha0` and `beta0` are learned from the data using [maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation), although other approaches, such as ["method of moments"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moments_(statistics)) could be used. (Heck, you could even defensibly choose these "hyperparameters" yourself, without any fancy statistics, if you feel that you have enough knowledge of the data.)

### Gamma-Poisson EB estimation

Now, for my replication of Shaw's analysis, we're going to be focusing on the ratio of a player's goals, $G$, divided by their [expected goals](/posts/epl-xpts-simulation-1)), $xG$, summed up over a fixed time period. Shaw refers to this as "overperformance" $O$ for a player $p$:

$$
O_p = \frac{G_p}{xG_p}
$$ {#eq-o}

While one might be tempted to use Beta-Binomial EB since this setup seems similar to batting average in @eq-ba, Shaw used a [Gamma-Poisson](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-5#gamma-poisson-conjugate-family) EB adjustment, and justifiably so. Gamma-Poisson makes more sense when the underlying data consists of counts *and* what you're trying to estimate is a rate or ratio, not a proportion bounded between 0 and 1. Note that a $O_p$ ratio of 1 indicates that a player is scoring as many goals as expected; a ratio greater than 1 indicates underperformance; and a ratio less than 1 indicates overperformance. On, the other hand, batting average is bounded between 0 and 1.

Now, despite the naming of conjugate prior pairs--e.g. "Beta-Binomial" and "Gamma-Poisson", where the prior distribution is represented by the first distribution and the likelihood distribution is indicated by the second--let's not forget that there are actually a third distribution to be noted: the posterior. In the case of the Gamma-Poisson model, the unnormalized posterior distribution of the "kernel" (i.e. the prior and likelihood pair) is a Gamma distribution. (This is always the case with Gamma-Prior kernels.)

In practice, this means that we'll be using the Gamma distribution for both estimating hyperparameters and posterior sampling. Perhaps surprising to the reader, you won't actually need any Poisson functions in the code implementation. Rather, the Poisson distribution is pertinent to implementation only to the extent that the Gamma distribution happens to be the most reasonable distribution to pair with it.

I've woefully explained away a lot of details here, but hopefully this all makes sense to those with a basic understanding of the Gamma and Poisson distributions themselves.

## Implementation

Ok, so with all of that context provided, now let's do the replication of Shaw's findings.

### Data

First, let's pull the data we'll need--2016/17 and 2017/18 [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com) shots, goals, and [xG](https://theanalyst.com/na/2023/08/what-is-expected-goals-xg/) by player. I'm using [understat](https://understat.com/)'s xG data since it's a fairly reliable source of data and is easy to retrieve data from via the [`{worldfootballR}` package](https://jaseziv.github.io/worldfootballR/).[^3]

[^3]: [FBRef](https://fbref.com/en/expected-goals-model-explained/) only provides expected goals dating back to the 2017/18 season, so unfortunately it's not viable for this analysis.

Note that Shaw used data from a provider, [Stratagem](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratagem-ltd/about/), that no long provides data, as far as I can tell. For at least this reason, I won't be able to exactly match his reason.[^4]

[^4]: The other major reason why I may not be able to match his results is if I've implemented the Gamma-Poisson adjustment in a different (hopefully, not incorrect 😅) manner.

### EB step 1: estimate prior hyperparameters

Next, we estimate hyperparameters for our prior gamma distribution using MLE. (With R's `dgamma`, the hyperparameters are `shape` and `rate`[^5]). I subset the data down to players having taken at least 50 shots for estimating these hyperparameters, as this is what Shaw does. In general, you'd want to filter your data here to records that provide good "signal", and, therefore, will provide reliable estimates of your hyperparameters.[^6]

[^5]: In [the wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution), you'll see `alpha` and `beta` used to describe the hyperparameters. `shape` and `rate` are different ways of framing these parameters.

[^6]: Note that this process of selecting priors is the "twist" I mentioned in the introduction that really separates empirical Bayes estimation from a traditional, full Bayesian approach. In the latter, one chooses priors for an analysis without using the data to be included in the analysis.

```{r}
#| label: prior_distr
#| code-fold: false
prior_shots_by_player <- dplyr::filter(
  shots_by_player, 
  shots >= 50,
  g > 0 ## prevent error with fitting prior distribution
)

prior_distr <- MASS::fitdistr(
  prior_shots_by_player$raw_ratio,
  dgamma,
  start = list(shape = 1, rate = 1)
)
prior_shape <- prior_distr$estimate[1]
prior_rate <- prior_distr$estimate[2]
list(prior_shape = round(prior_shape, 2), prior_rate = round(prior_rate, 2))
#> $prior_shape
#> shape 
#>  9.39 
#> 
#> $prior_rate
#> rate 
#> 8.93
```

### EB step 2: Use prior distribution to sample the posterior

Now we start with our prior distribution hyperparameters and update all players' $O$ ratio based on their individual evidence, i.e. their exact volume of goals and xG.

```{r}
#| data-label: adj_ratio_by_player
#| code-fold: false
simulate_gamma_posterior <- function(
    successes, 
    trials, 
    prior_shape, 
    prior_rate, 
    n_sims = 10000,
    seed = 42
) {
  posterior_shape <- prior_shape + successes
  posterior_rate <- prior_rate + trials
  withr::local_seed(seed)
  posterior_sample <- rgamma(n = n_sims, shape = posterior_shape, rate = posterior_rate)
  list(
    mean = mean(posterior_sample),
    sd = sd(posterior_sample)
  )
}

shots_by_player$adj_ratio <- purrr::map2(
  shots_by_player$g, shots_by_player$xg,
  function(g, xg) {
    simulate_gamma_posterior(
      successes = g,
      trials = xg,
      prior_shape = prior_shape,
      prior_rate = prior_rate
    )
  }
)

adj_ratio_by_player <- shots_by_player |> 
  tidyr::unnest_wider(
    adj_ratio, 
    names_sep = '_'
  ) |> 
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(adj_ratio_mean))
adj_ratio_by_player
#> # A tibble: 588 × 7
#>    player            shots     g    xg raw_ratio adj_ratio_mean adj_ratio_sd
#>    <chr>             <int> <int> <dbl>     <dbl>          <dbl>        <dbl>
#>  1 Fernando Llorente    57    16  9.19      1.74           1.40        0.281
#>  2 Philippe Coutinho   160    20 12.5       1.60           1.37        0.256
#>  3 Shkodran Mustafi     37     5  1.82      2.75           1.34        0.357
#>  4 Pascal Groß          43     7  3.34      2.10           1.34        0.334
#>  5 Ryan Fraser          55     8  4.09      1.95           1.34        0.324
#>  6 Eden Hazard         148    28 19.2       1.45           1.33        0.219
#>  7 James McArthur       53    10  5.93      1.69           1.31        0.299
#>  8 Charlie Daniels      39     5  2.18      2.30           1.30        0.346
#>  9 Xherdan Shaqiri     117    12  7.61      1.58           1.29        0.282
#> 10 Andy Carroll         67    10  6.09      1.64           1.29        0.296
#> # ℹ 578 more rows
```

Now let's plot our results, plotting our adjusted mean estimates of $O_p$, ±1 standard deviation about the adjusted mean. As noted earlier, we won't achieve exactly the same results as Shaw due to using a different set of xG values, but evidently we've achieved results reasonably close to his.

## Conclusion

Having not seen a very clear example of Gamma-Prior EB implementation on the internet--although there are several good explanations with toy examples such as [this e-book chapter from Hyvönen and Topias Tolonen](https://vioshyvo.github.io/Bayesian_inference/conjugate-distributions.html)--I hope I've perhaps un-muddied the waters for at least one interested reader.

As for the actual application of $G / xG$ for evaluating shooting performance, I have mixed feelings about it. Further analysis shows that it has basically zero year-over-year stability, i.e. one shouldn't use a player's raw or adjusted G/xG ratio in one season to try to predict whether their overperformance ratio will sustain in the next season. On the other hand, by simply making player estimates more comparable, the EB adjustment of $O_p$ certainly is an improvement over raw $G / xG$ itself.

Comparing hypothetical player A with 6 goals on 2 xG ($O_p = 3$) vs. player B with 120 goals on 100 xG directly ($O_p = 1.2$) is unfair; the former could be performing at an unsustainable rate, while the latter has demonstrated sustained overperformance over a lot more time. Indeed, applying the EB adjustment to these hypothetical numbers, player A's $O_p$ would be shrunken back towards 1, and player B's adjustment would be basically nothing, indicating that player B's shooting performance is stronger, on average.
