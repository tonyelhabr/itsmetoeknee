# Introduction

Once upon a time I wrote about the "Bundesliga tax", generating a set of generic "lookup tables" one could use to forecast the performance drop off (or improvement) when transferring from one major league to another. That's one end of the spectrum.

The other end of the spectrum is "How unexpected (or "unlikely") was player X's shooting performance this season?" That question is often posed when observing a large difference in a player's goals scored and expected goals (xG). For instance, if a player only scored 5 goals in a given season on 8 xG, their "under-performance" of 3 goals is certainly notable, as its about 37.5% lower than expected (i.e. `(5 - 8) / 8`). The "Overperformance ($O$)" ratio of goals to expected goals (G / xG)--[I've written about before](posts/xg-ratio-empirical-bayes/)--is the common way of understanding shooting performance. Intuitively, an $O$ ratio of 1 indicates that a player is scoring as many goals as expected; a ratio greater than 1 indicates underperformance; and a ratio less than 1 indicates overperformance

Since then, I've been asked how would go about quantifying how unlikely an individual player's season was.

In this post I show several approaches to doing so.
