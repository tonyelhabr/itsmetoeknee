# Introduction

Towards the end of each soccer season, we naturally start to look back at player performances, often looking to seems to have improved the most compared to their past seasons. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, who disappointed the most. We may have different motivations for doing so--e.g. we may be trying to attribute team over- and under-performance to individuals, we may be hypothesizing who is likely to be transferred or resigned, etc.

The question "How unexpected (or "unlikely") was player X's shooting performance this season?" is often posed when observing a large difference in a player's goals scored and [expected goals (xG)](https://theanalyst.com/na/2021/07/what-are-expected-goals-xg/). For instance, if a striker only scored 8 goals in a given season on 12 xG, their "underperformance" of 4 goals is certainly notable, as its about 50% lower than expected (i.e. `(8 - 12) / 12`).

The ["Outperformance" ($O$) ratio](posts/xg-ratio-empirical-bayes/) of non-penalty goals to expected goals ($O = \frac{G}{xG}$) is perhaps the most common way of evaluating shooting performance.[^1] Intuitively, an $O$ ratio of 1 indicates that a player is scoring as many goals as expected; a ratio greater than 1 indicates underperformance; and a ratio less than 1 indicates overperformance. Our hypothetical player underperformed with an $O$ ratio of 0.67 (i.e. $O = \frac{8}{12} = 0.75$).

[^1]: The raw difference between goals and xG is another reasonable measure of shooting performance, but it can "hide" shot volume. Is it fair to compare a player who take 100 shots in a year and scores 12 goals on 10 xG with a player who takes 10 shots and scores 3 goals on 1 xG? The raw difference is +2 in both cases, indicating no difference in the shooting performance for the two players. But $O$ would be 1.2 and 3 respectively, hinting at the former player's small sample size (since no one can reasonably expect to sustain an $O$ greater than 1.5 or 2 over many shots).

In most cases, we have prior seasons of data to use when evaluating a player's $O$ ratio for a given season. For example, let's say our hypothetical player scored 12 goals on 10 xG ($O = 1.2$) in the season prior, and 11 goals on 10 xG ($O = 1.1$) before that. Putting things in perspective, an $O = 0.75$ after those performances seems even more likely, compared to an "average" player who theoretically achieves $O = 1$ ratio every year.

So how do we put a number on the unlikeliness of that $O = 0.75$ for our hypothetical player, accounting for their prior season-long performances?

### Data

For this post, I'll be using public data from [FBref](https://fbref.com/) for the 2018/19 - 2023/24 seasons of the [the Big 5 European soccer leagues](https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats). Fake data is nice for examples, but ultimately we want to test our methods on real data. Our intuition about the results can be a useful caliber of the sensibility of our results.

We'll focus on one player in particular--[James Maddison](https://fbref.com/en/players/ee38d9c5/James-Maddison) and [Matheus Cunha](https://fbref.com/en/players/dc62b55d/Matheus-Cunha). Maddison has had a sub-par 2023/2024 season for his own standards, underperforming his xG for the first time in since he started playing in the Premier League in 2018/19. On the other hand, Cunha--who has bounced around teams across the Bundesliga, La Liga, and most recently the Premier League--has overperformed his xG for the first time this season.

## Analysis

### Approach 1: $t$-test

If you have some background in statistics, perhaps the first approach that comes to mind is a [$t$-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) (using shot-weighted averages and standard deviations).

```{r}
#| label: select_np_season_shooting-t-test
#| code-fold: false
#| code-summary: "Performing a t-test for likelihood of Maddison's 2024 outperformance"
LATEST_SEASON_END_YEAR <- 2024

select_np_season_shooting |> 
  dplyr::filter(season_end_year < LATEST_SEASON_END_YEAR) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(
    .by = c(player),
    mean = weighted.mean(o, w = shots),
    ## could also use a function like Hmisc::wtd.var for weighted variance
    sd = sqrt(sum(shots * (o - weighted.mean(o, w = shots))^2) / sum(shots))
  ) |> 
  dplyr::inner_join(
    select_np_season_shooting |> 
      dplyr::filter(season_end_year == LATEST_SEASON_END_YEAR) |> 
      dplyr::select(player, latest_o = o),
    by = dplyr::join_by(player)
  ) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    z_score = (latest_o - mean) / sd,
    p_value = 2 * pnorm(-abs(z_score))
  )
#> [1] 0.1705488
```

In reality, this isn't giving us a percentage of likelihood of the outcome. Rather, the p-value measures the probability of obtaining an outperformance as extreme as the one observed in 2023/24 (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis in this case would be that there is no significant difference between the player's actual outperformance ratio in the 2023/24 season and the distribution of outperformance ratios observed in previous seasons.

The t-test indicates that Cunha's goals-to-xG ratio this year violates the null hypothesis, suggesting that this season has been significantly remarkable for him. On the other hand, the t-test indicates that there is **not** sufficient evidence that Maddison's $O$ this season is significantly worse than his $O$ in prior seasons

### Approach 2: Sampling from Shrunken Outperformance Estimates

Pulling from [my own prior art](/posts/xg-empirical-bayes), we can apply [Gamma-Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method#Poisson%E2%80%93gamma_model) [Empirical Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method) (EB) shrinkage to create a better estimate what each player's "true" outperformance ratio $O$ is, up through the latest season. Typically we'd summarize the posterior distribution in EB estimation with the mean, e.g. "Maddison's observed outperformance ratio through 2022/23 is 1.21, and his shrunken EB estimate (mean of the posterior) is 1.13".

But we can do more with the posterior distribution. For estimating the unlikelihood of observed 2023/24 outcomes, we can count up in how many posterior samples a player's outperformance ratio is less than his actual 2023/24 outperformance ratio.

We can do something similar to see how unlikely Cunha's overperformance in 2023/24 was.

```{r}
#| label: prop_sims_with_latest_actual-maddison
#| code-fold: false
#| code-summary: "Count of Cunha's EB posterior samples below his actual 2023/24 outperformance ratio"
cunha_prop_sims_with_latest_actual <- prop_sims_with_latest_actual |> 
  dplyr::filter(player == 'Matheus Cunha')

cunha_prop_sims_with_latest_actual |> 
  dplyr::select(
    player,
    prior_o = o,
    adj_o_mean,
    latest_o,
    prop_gte
  )
#> # A tibble: 1 × 5
#>   player        prior_o adj_o_mean latest_o prop_gte
#>   <chr>           <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
#> 1 Matheus Cunha   0.772      0.823     1.16   0.0214
```

Cunha's 2023/24 $O$ of 1.16 (or better) is only seen in 2.14% of simulations.

Unfortunately, looking at the whole spectrum of players, it looks like this approach tends to over- and under-estimate likelihood. The histogram below shows that this approach finds that over 50% of player outcomes in the 2023/24 season were less than 5% likely. This is clearly miscalibrated--we should expect to see just 5% of player $O$ values being only 5% likely in any given season.

```{r}
maddison_posterior_samples_plot <- maddison_posterior_samples |> 
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(
    x = adj_o_samples
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram(
    ggplot2::aes(fill = group),
    binwidth = 0.01,
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_manual(
    values = group_palette
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_vline(
    ggplot2::aes(xintercept = 1),
    color = 'white',
    linetype = 1,
    linewidth = 1.5
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_vline(
    ggplot2::aes(xintercept = mean(adj_o_samples)),
    color = 'white',
    linetype = 2,
    linewidth = 1
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: prior_o_bucket-plot-debug
#| include: false
#| 
prop_sims_with_latest_actual |> 
  mutate(
    prior_o_bucket = cut(
      prior_o,
      c(-Inf, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1.1, 1.25, 1.5, Inf)
    )
  ) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(
    x = prop_lte,
    y = lower_tail
  ) +
  geom_abline(
    aes(slope = 1, intercept = 0),
    color = 'white',
    linetype = 2,
    linewidth = 2
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(size = prior_shots, color = prior_o_bucket)
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = 'H')
```

```{r}
#| label: eb-posterior-sampling-2
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Sampling from a posterior distribution again, including 2023/24"

```

Without sampling from the posterior, we could achieve basically the same result using an appropriate distribution function. (We couldn't have done this before because our prior distribution was fit on all players, so `pgamma()` and counting up posterior samples would not provide the same likelihood estimation.)

```{r}
pgamma(
  maddison_prop_sims_with_latest_actual$latest_o,
  shape = prior_params$shape, 
  rate = prior_params$rate
)
#> [1] 0.09778753
```

### Approach 2: Sampling from Prior History of Shots

```{r}
#| label: shots
raw_shots <- worldfootballR::load_fb_match_shooting(
  country = c('ENG', 'ESP', 'GER', 'ITA', 'FRA'),
  tier = '1st',
  gender = 'M',
  season_end_year = c(2018:2024)
)

players_of_interest <- c("Erling Haaland", "Harry Kane")
shots <- raw_shots |> 
  filter(Player %in% players_of_interest) |> 
  ## Drop penalties
  filter(
    !coalesce((Distance == '13' & round(as.double(xG), 2) == 0.79), FALSE)
  ) |> 
  transmute(
    season_start_year = Season_End_Year - 1,
    player = Player,
    g = as.integer(Outcome == 'Goal'),
    xg = as.double(xG)
  )
```

### Approach 4: Sampling from Entire History of Shots

### Approach 5: Sampling from Entire History of Shots, Resampling Outcomes

# Conclusion

Once upon a time I wrote about [quantifying the relative strength of top tier domestic soccer leagues](posts/soccer-league-strength). The main motivation for this was to have a general framework with which to forecast the performance drop off (or improvement) of a player when transferring from one major league to another, i.e. to answer "How many more or less goals might we expect from player X when they transfer from league A to league B?". Notably, Erling Haaland's transfer from the Bundesliga to the English Premier League vehemently defied the figures I found there, which showed around a 17% drop off.
