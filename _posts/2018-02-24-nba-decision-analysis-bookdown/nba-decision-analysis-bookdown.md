I’m happy to announce that I’ve finished converting the bulk of my old
posts to an e-book, using the [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/)’s
wonderful [`{bookdown}` package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
The e-book is live [on the docs branch of a GitHub
repo](https://tonyelhabr.github.io/nba-decision_analysis/).

The posts (now chapters) apply concepts in the field of [decision
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis) to evaluate
“value” in the NBA Draft. Although analysis of the NBA draft itself is
certainly not novel and , I think my approach is fairly original.
Additionally, even though my perspective is not extremely “technical”
(there is 0 code in the book), I think the content will serve as a good
illustration of how far I have progressed as an analyst when I review
and compare it to my level of analysis at any given time now and in the
future.
