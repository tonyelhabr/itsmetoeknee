## Introduction

This is an intro

## Set-up

Your full db url should be something like \<postgres://username:[password\@understatdb.cvpu12345abc.us-east-2.redshift.amazonaws.com](mailto:password@understatdb.cvpu12345abc.us-east-2.redshift.amazonaws.com){.email}:5439/dev>

-   Make the cluster to public: From anywhere on your cluster dashboard, click on the "Actions" dropdown and selecting "modify publicly accessible setting")
-   Update the inbound rules: From the Properties tab, click on the link for "VPC security group" under the "Network and security" settings card. This should open a new browser tab. In the security group details menu on the bottom half of the screen, select the "Inbound rules" tab, then the "Edit inbound rules" tab. You'll need to change the source to 0.0.0.0/0

If you have other issues connecting to your new cluster, try the things described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb6pwNrBt_Y)
